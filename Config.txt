# N_CH = number of channels
N_CH  16

# RECORD_LENGTH = number of samples in the acquisition window
RECORD_LENGTH  500



# POST_TRIGGER: post trigger size in percent of the whole acquisition window
# options: 0 to 100
#POST_TRIGGER  50

#PULSE_POLARITY: input signal polarity.
#options: POSITIVE, NEGATIVE
#
#PULSE_POLARITY  POSITIVE
PULSE_POLARITY  NEGATIVE

# EXTERNAL_TRIGGER: external trigger input settings. When enabled, the ext. trg. can be either 
# propagated (ACQUISITION_AND_TRGOUT) or not (ACQUISITION_ONLY) through the TRGOUT
# options: DISABLED, ACQUISITION_ONLY, ACQUISITION_AND_TRGOUT
EXTERNAL_TRIGGER   DISABLED	

# IO_LEVEL: type of the front panel I/O LEMO connectors 
# options: NIM, TTL
IO_LEVEL  NIM

EVENT_AGGR 1

# NOTE: reasonable values should keep a margin of 10%, otherwise the
# actual baseline level may differ from the specified one.
BASELINE_LEVEL  50

# TRIGGER_THRESHOLD: threshold for the channel auto trigger (ADC counts)
# options 0 to 2^N-1 (N=Number of bit of the ADC)
# *The threshold is relative to the baseline:
# 	POSITIVE PULSE POLARITY: threshold = baseline + TRIGGER_THRESHOLD
# 	NEGATIVE PULSE POLARITY: threshold = baseline - TRIGGER_THRESHOLD
#
TRIGGER_THRESHOLD      100

# CHANNEL_TRIGGER: channel auto trigger settings. When enabled, the ch. auto trg. can be either 
# propagated (ACQUISITION_AND_TRGOUT) or not (ACQUISITION_ONLY) through the TRGOUT
# options: DISABLED, ACQUISITION_ONLY, ACQUISITION_AND_TRGOUT, TRGOUT_ONLY
# NOTE: since in x730 boards even and odd channels are paired, their 'CHANNEL_TRIGGER' value
# will be equal to the OR combination of the pair, unless one of the two channels of
# the pair is set to 'DISABLED'. If so, the other one behaves as usual.
ACQ_MODE        ACQUISITION_ONLY
